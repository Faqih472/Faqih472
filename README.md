### 🚀 Featured Projects
*Full-scale applications I developed for business, utility, and AI integration.*

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎙️ VoxMod** | AI Voice Changer app that lets users transform their voice into various characters, including Anime and Vtuber models like Keqing, Klee, or Zeta. Users record their voice, send it to the backend powered by RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) via FastAPI, and receive the converted audio. Features include dynamic pitch adjustment, regenerate logic to edit pitch without re-recording, and a Flutter mobile client with smooth UI and interactive audio controls. | `Flutter` `FastAPI` `PyTorch` |
